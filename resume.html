<p>I’m submitting an application for the Web Producer position you advertised on your website on March 3rd, 2016. I am interested in applying for the position of Web Producer at your company and would like you to consider me for the role.</p>
<p>I have a background in web development and experience of successfully designing a website layout, usability and appearance. Over the last year, I’ve had the opportunity of working for a variety of businesses and with this, has given me extensive web designing knowledge and technical skills.</p>
 <p>A quick review of my attached resume will show that I have been involved in the creation of websites that incorporated dynamic images while using Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator and Photoshop), WordPress integration, ecommerce capabilities and scripting languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. I also possess excellent communication skills and am comfortable working on projects as part of a team or individually.</p>

 <p>I am in the Greater Seattle area and can locate if the opportunity comes.

   I learned HTML and CSS while attending Seattle Central Community College while obtaining the Web Design Certification.  I can start as soon as possible.  My salary qualifications would be a salary of $40,000-$45,000.</p>


<p>Please free to contact me if you require clarification or any further information and referrals.
I look forward to discussing my qualifications further and can be reached by email at nectar.shakir@gmail.com  or by phone at 773.370.5202.</p>
Thank you so much for your time.
Sincerely,
<h5>Nectar Shakir</h5></p>
